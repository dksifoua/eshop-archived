3. Implementation/Coding
With the design in place, developers can start writing code:
Set up the development environment and tools
Implement the core functionality in small, testable modules
Follow coding standards and best practices
Conduct regular code reviews

5. Testing
Rigorous testing is crucial to ensure the software works as intended:
Develop and execute test cases for unit, integration, and system testing
Perform functional and non-functional testing (performance, security, etc.)
Conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders
Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing

7. Deployment
Once testing is complete, the software can be deployed to production:
Prepare the production environment
Migrate data if required
Deploy the application and verify it's working correctly
Provide user training and documentation

9. Maintenance and Support
After deployment, ongoing maintenance is needed:
Monitor system performance and usage
Apply patches and updates as needed
Provide technical support to end-users
Implement new features and enhancements over time
